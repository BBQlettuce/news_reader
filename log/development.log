The ancient humanoid, who may have stood about five feet tall, appears to have been slender and upright. Its feet seem to have been built for long-distance running. The arms are ape-like, and hands are human-like. The skull is tiny—only a third the volume of a \\u003Cem\\u003EHomo\\u003C/em\\u003E \\u003Cem\\u003Esapien\\u003C/em\\u003E\\u0026#8216;s\\u003Cem\\u003E \\u003C/em\\u003Ebrain.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EThe other intriguing find is that, apart from those 15 skeletons, the hard-to-reach cave was bare. “We found nothing else, and the only time you ever find just one thing is when humans deliberately do it,” Berger told The Atlantic.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EThe speculation is that the species may have \\u0026#8220;buried\\u0026#8221; their dead, which is something that isn\\u0026#8217;t seen in most ancient human species. Of course, speculation is all that is because we know don\\u0026#8217;t know any more about \\u003Cem\\u003EH. naledi\\u003C/em\\u003E.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EBerger and his colleagues haven\\u0026#8217;t even dated the bones yet. The species could be millions of years old or only thousands of years old, and that would mean very different things for where it fits in the human tree.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EThere is also a chance that the species is not really as new as believed. Some past claims have \\u003Ca href=\\\"https://theconversation.com/of-heads-and-headlines-can-a-skull-doom-14-human-species-19227\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\u003Enot held up\\u003C/a\\u003E under more detailed scrutiny.

Performing head scans for typical migraine syndromes often produce a very low yield in clinically relevant findings (0.6% in one \\u003Ca href=\\\"http://www.academicradiology.org/article/S1076-6332(03)80548-2/abstract\\\"\\u003Eretrospective study\\u003C/a\\u003E, 0.9% in another \\u003Ca href=\\\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15606567\\\"\\u003Eprospective trial\\u003C/a\\u003E), so this diagnosis is commonly made based on a patient’s history and exam. Yet the high incidence of head imaging used for migraines visits (almost 10% in an \\u003Ca href=\\\"https://archinte.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=1835347\\\"\\u003Eobservational study\\u003C/a\\u003E conducted this past year) suggests an epidemic of over-use.

In this audit study of 23 symptoms-checking websites, the correct diagnosis of standardized patient vignettes were only found in their top 20 diagnoses around 58% of the time. Given that several symptom-checker websites have the ability to suggest the need for lab tests or imaging, it sets these tech-savvy patients up for confusion and frustration when their clinicians recommend against further work-up after making their own expert diagnosis.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EWhere the use of diagnostic technology lies mostly in the hands of medical providers, patients may soon come in to the doctor’s office with blood work they \\u003Ca href=\\\"http://www.azcentral.com/story/money/business/consumer/2015/04/07/patients-can-soon-get-lab-tests-without-doctors-orders/25413251/\\\"\\u003Eindependently collect\\u003C/a\\u003E from outside laboratory facilities.

Since there are approximately half a million more Muslims in the US than the UK (\\u003Ca href=\\\"http://www.pewforum.org/2011/01/27/the-future-of-the-global-muslim-population/\\\"\\u003E3.3 million\\u003C/a\\u003E vs \\u003Ca href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islam_in_the_United_Kingdom\\\"\\u003E2.8 million\\u003C/a\\u003E), the contrast is even starker.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003ESo what does the difference in the numbers of American and British Muslims going to Syria tell us about the fight against ISIL?\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EGiven the globalized nature of its propaganda, the number of recruits ISIL gets per country cannot just be about exposure to extremist views. Instead, the culture and the networks that have developed per country have a bigger impact. In other words, it’s likely that as many American Muslims have been exposed to ISIL’s propaganda as British Muslims have, but the latter are more likely to act on it.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EBefore exploring this further, it needs to be said that British Muslims should not be held responsible for the actions of a few extremists, and neither should they be forced to police their own neighbors and friends. And yet, to defeat ISIL requires starving them of new recruits and British Muslims themselves can play an active role in that. After all, it is their own families most at risk of being torn apart and fellow Muslims who are the biggest victims of ISIL’s murderous rampage.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003ESo why are British Muslims losing the war against ISIL? Here are a few reasons:\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Ch2\\u003E\\u003Cstrong\\u003EThe caliphate and jihad\\u003C/strong\\u003E\\u003C/h2\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EA key part of the problem that British Muslim history is littered with groups and activists who have advocated going abroad to fight and defend fellow Muslims, and/or striving for a caliphate (“\\u003Cem\\u003Ekhilafah\\u003C/em\\u003E”).\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EThe extremist group Hizb ut-Tahrir (HuT) was famous for advocating a global caliphate that would be free of corruption, infighting, foreign invasion, or poverty. This vision was so seductive that it would command \\u003Ca href=\\\"http://qz.com/354227/isil-is-growing-and-this-is-why/\\\"\\u003Eup to 10,000 Muslims to its conferences\\u003C/a\\u003E not long ago. That aspiration for a perfect Muslim land has not gone away as Arab dictatorships continue to persist and disappoint.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003ENeither is it rare to hear the call to go abroad and fight. At a HuT rally in 2006, activist Asim Qureshi \\u003Ca href=\\\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXGPqyK3Srg\\\"\\u003Etold the crowd\\u003C/a\\u003E: “When we see the example of our brothers and sisters fighting, in Chechnya, Iraq, Palestine, Kashmir, Afghanistan, then we know where the example lies \\u0026#8230; it is incumbent upon all of us to support the jihad of our brothers and sisters in these countries when they are facing the oppression of the West.” His call was greeted by the crowd, and similar pleas have been made countless times since at rallies or on YouTube videos. Qureshi now runs CAGE, an organization popular with British Muslims for defending Guantánamo Bay detainees.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EThat potent mix of two ideas: that Muslims are obliged to strive for a Caliphate, and they should go abroad to defend the \\u003Cem\\u003EUmmah\\u003C/em\\u003E, has a long history of advocacy in the UK. It’s no wonder ISIS have found it relatively easier to recruit by exploiting both of them.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EThese examples illustrate a broader difference between the two continents. Maybe it is because Europeans are closer to the Middle East, or that US Muslims are better off and more culturally integrated, or that America isn’t averse to religion in public life like Europe is. Either way, British Muslims seem to look abroad for political involvement and direct action far more American Muslims do, suggesting they feel more politically disconnected back at home.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Ch2\\u003E\\u003Cstrong\\u003ELittle space for secular or liberal voices\\u003C/strong\\u003E\\u003C/h2\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EChallenging the narratives of extremists requires leadership and it requires a diversity of voices.

Even if these religious groups are ‘illiberal,’ no one questions their American-ness, and no one should. In this sense, American Muslims aren’t compelled to choose. They can be religious, outwardly Muslim, anti-secular, whatever, but they can be all of those things and still embrace being or becoming American.”\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EThough the overwhelming majority of Muslims in Britain \\u003Ca href=\\\"http://comres.co.uk/polls/bbc-radio-4-today-muslim-poll/\\\"\\u003Esee themselves\\u003C/a\\u003E as “British,” it doesn’t mean they have taken ownership of that hybrid identity and developed it.

But perhaps these contributions say more about the impact of a university or college than test scores and future earnings. Which universities are \\u003Cem\\u003Emost likely\\u003C/em\\u003E to produce individuals with lasting effect on our world?\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EThe \\u003Ca href=\\\"http://colleges.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/best-colleges\\\"\\u003EUS News college rankings\\u003C/a\\u003E emphasize subjective reputation, student retention, selectivity, graduation rate, faculty and financial resources and alumni giving. Recently, other rankings have proliferated, including some based on objective long-term metrics such as individual earning potential. Yet, we know of no evaluations of colleges based on \\u003Cem\\u003Elasting contributions to society\\u003C/em\\u003E. Of course, such contributions are difficult to judge. In the analysis below, we focus primarily on STEM (science, technology, engineering and medicine/mathematics) contributions, which are arguably the least subjective to evaluate, and increasingly more valued in today’s workforce.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EWe examined six groups of exceptional achievers divided into two tiers, looking only at winners who attended college in the US. Our goal is to create a ranking among US colleges, but of course one could broaden the analysis if desired. The first level included all winners of the Nobel Prize (physics, chemistry, medicine, economics, literature, and peace), Fields Medal (mathematics) and the Turing Award (computer science). The second level included individuals elected to the National Academy of Sciences (NAS), National Academy of Engineering (NAE) or Institute of Medicine (IOM). The National Academies are representative of the top few thousand individuals in all of STEM.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EWe then traced each of these individuals back to their undergraduate days, creating two lists to examine whether the same or different schools rose to the top. We wanted to compare results across these two lists to see if findings in the first tier of achievement replicated in the second tier of achievement and to increase sample size to avoid the problem of statistical flukes.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003ESimply counting up the number of awards likely favors larger schools and alumni populations. We corrected for this by computing a \\u003Cem\\u003Eper capita\\u003C/em\\u003E rate of production, dividing the number of winners from a given university by an estimate of the relative size of the alumni population. Specifically, we used the total number of graduates over the period 1966-2013 (an alternative method of estimating base population over 100 to 150 years led to very similar lists). This allowed us to objectively compare newer and smaller schools with older and larger schools.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EIn order to reduce statistical noise, we eliminated schools with only one or two winners of the Nobel, Fields or Turing prize. This resulted in only 25 schools remaining, which are shown below:\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cdiv class=\\\"qz-table-container\\\"\\u003E\\n\\u003Ctable class=\\\"qz-table cf\\\"\\u003E\\n\\u003Cthead

results are strikingly similar across the two lists. If we had included schools with two winners in the Nobel/Fields/Turing list, Haverford, Oberlin, Rice, and Johns Hopkins would have been in the top 25 on both. For comparison, very good research universities such as #394 Arizona State, #396 Florida State and #411 University of Georgia are outperformed by the top school (Caltech) by 600 to 900 times. To \\u003Ca href=\\\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/0ByYDxaP-OyVjZVZXdHJLSjBHRDB6cVdHcERRNTdKcDNmZ3lV/view\\\"\\u003Egive a sense of the full range\\u003C/a\\u003E: the per capita rate of production of top school to bottom school was about 449 to one for the Nobel/Fields/Turing list and 1788 to one for the National Academies list. These lists include only schools that produced at least one winner—the majority of colleges have produced zero.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EWhat causes these drastically different odds ratios across a wide variety of leading schools?\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EThe top schools on our lists tend to be private, with significant financial resources. However, the top public university, UC Berkeley, is ranked highly on both lists: #13 on the Nobel/Fields/Turing and #31 on the National Academies. Perhaps surprisingly, many elite liberal arts colleges, even those not focused on STEM education, such as Swarthmore and Amherst, rose to the top. One could argue that the playing field here is fairly even: accomplished students at Ohio State, Penn State, Arizona State, Florida State and University of Georgia, which lag the leaders by factors of hundreds or almost a thousand, are likely to end up at the same highly ranked \\u003Cem\\u003Egraduate\\u003C/em\\u003E programs as individuals who attended top schools on our list. It seems reasonable to conclude that large differences in \\u003Cem\\u003Econcentration\\u003C/em\\u003E or \\u003Cem\\u003Edensity\\u003C/em\\u003E of highly able students are at least partly responsible for these differences in outcome.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003ESports fans are unlikely to be surprised by our results. Among all college athletes only a few will win professional or world championships. Some collegiate programs undoubtedly produce champions at a rate far in excess of others. It would be uncontroversial to attribute this differential rate of production both to differences in ability of recruited athletes as well as the impact of coaching and preparation during college. Just as Harvard has a far higher percentage of students scoring 1600 on the SAT than most schools and provides advanced courses suited to those individuals, Alabama may have more freshman defensive ends who can run the forty yard dash in under 4.6 seconds, and the coaches who can prepare them for the NFL.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EOne intriguing result is the strong correlation (r ~ 0.5) between our ranking (over all universities) and the average SAT score of each student population, which suggests that cognitive ability, as measured by standardized tests, likely has something to do with great contributions later in life. By selecting heavily on measurable characteristics such as cognitive ability, an institution obtains a student body with a much higher likelihood of achievement. The identification of ability here is probably not primarily due to “holistic review” by admissions committees: Caltech is famously numbers-driven in its selection (it has the \\u003Ca href=\\\"http://www.businessinsider.com/smartest-colleges-in-america-2014-10\\\"\\u003Ehighest SAT/ACT scores\\u003C/a\\u003E), and outperforms the other top schools by a sizeable margin. While admission to one of the colleges on the lists above is no guarantee of important achievements later in life, the probability is much higher for these select matriculants.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EWe cannot say whether outstanding achievement should be attributed to the personal traits of the individual which unlocked the door to admission, the education and experiences obtained at the school, or benefits from alumni networks and reputation. These are questions worthy of continued investigation. Our findings identify schools that excel at producing impact, and our method introduces a new way of thinking about and evaluating what makes a college or university great. Perhaps college rankings should be less subjective and more focused on objective real world achievements of graduates.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\u003Cimg alt=\\\"\\\" border=\\\"0\\\" src=\\\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=qz.com\\u0026#038;blog=39587363\\u0026#038;post=498534\\u0026#038;subd=qzprod\\u0026#038;ref=\\u0026#038;feed=1\\\" width=\\\"1\\\" height=\\\"1\\\" /\\u003E\",\"comments\":\"http://qz.com/498534/these-25-schools-are-responsible-for-the-greatest-advances-in-science/#comments\",\"pubDate\":\"2015-09-10T08:00:00-04:00\",\"category\":\"Uncategorized\",\"guid\":\"http://qz.com/preview/498534\",\"dc_creator\":\"Steve Hsu and Jonathan Wai\",\"media_content_url\":\"http://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/dredwardlewis.jpg?quality=80\\u0026#038;strip=all\\u0026#038;w=150\",\"media_content_type\":\"html\",\"media_title\":\"dredwardlewis\",\"media_thumbnail_url\":\"http://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/dredwardlewis.jpg?quality=80\\u0026#038;strip=all\\u0026#038;w=150\"}"], ["link", "http://qz.com/498534/these-25-schools-are-responsible-for-the-greatest-advances-in-science/"], ["published_at", Thu, 10 Sep 2015 12:00:00 UTC +00:00], ["title", "These 25 schools are responsible for the greatest advances in science"], ["updated_at", Thu, 10 Sep 2015 14:20:29 UTC +00:00]]

But exaggerating the likelihood of extreme outcomes not only give deniers ammunition, it undermines convincing—even if not entirely certain—science. Gernot Wagner, the lead senior economist for the Environmental Defense Fund and research association at Harvard Kennedy School, told Quartz: \\u0026#8220;Even enviros get it wrong, they have a knee jerk reaction against anyone who questions the science.\\u0026#8221;\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EWagner and Martin L.

They use finance theory to argue the presence of risk is precisely why we need to limit carbon emissions sooner rather than later. In finance, risk poses a cost. You can pay to reduce it and often, the sooner you do, the cheaper it is to deal with the risk.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EAnd the fact is, there still exists considerable uncertainty around the consequences of climate change. We know the planet is getting warmer. According to a \\u003Ca href=\\\"http://www.ipcc.ch/\\\"\\u003Ereport from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change\\u003C/a\\u003E (IPCC), the last 30 years may be the warmest in the last 1,400 years in the Northern hemisphere—the globally averaged temperature increased 0.85°C from 1880 to 2012.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EWe also know that humans are largely to blame. But our precise share is hard to know. Some of the temperature increase is caused by man and some of it may be naturally occurring because global temperatures naturally vary. The evidence is very compelling that human activity is responsible for a large share of global warming. Since the industrial revolution, humans have burned lots of fossil fuels, which release carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. The fossil fuels have increased the atmospheric concentrations of CO2 to unprecedented levels, at least within the last 800,00o years. We\\u0026#8217;ve known since the 19th century that higher levels of CO2 increases the earth\\u0026#8217;s temperature. The fact that we put lots of CO2 into the atmosphere and temperatures have since increased makes a compelling case we\\u0026#8217;re largely at fault.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EWe\\u0026#8217;re already seeing the effects. According to the IPCC:\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cblockquote\\u003E\\u003Cp\\u003EIt is likely that the frequency of heat waves has increased in large parts of Europe, Asia and Australia. It is very likely that human influence has contributed to the observed global scale changes in the frequency and intensity of daily temperature extremes since the mid-20th century. It is likely that human influence has more than doubled the probability of occurrence of heat waves in some locations. There is medium confidence that the observed warming has increased heat-related human mortality and decreased cold-related human mortality in some regions.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\u003C/blockquote\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EBut we still don\\u0026#8217;t really know what it will mean for the planet long-term. Humans are on track to double the amount of Co2 in the atmosphere by the end of the century. But how much that will increase global temperatures and how the planet will respond remain big unknowns. The current projections (the same for the last 30 years) estimate that if C02 concentrations double, temperatures will increase between 1.5°C and 4.5°C. That\\u0026#8217;s a huge range. A 4.5°C increase could be catastrophic and more than that could make the planet uninhabitable. Wagner estimates there\\u0026#8217;s a 10% chance of a catastrophic outcome. \\u0026#8220;That may be unlikely, but it\\u0026#8217;s a huge freakin\\u0026#8217; problem,\\u0026#8221; he told Quartz.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EOn the more positive end of the spectrum, temperatures might not increase much and the effects will be fairly benign—but that\\u0026#8217;s also a tail case. The most likely outcome is a rise in temperature that will change how we, especially \\u003Ca href=\\\"http://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/farmers-adapt-to-climate-change-by-bill-gates-2015-09\\\"\\u003Epoor people\\u003C/a\\u003E, live and cause more extreme weather. But the range of consequences is rarely communicated, John Richardson writes in Esquire:\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cblockquote\\u003E\\u003Cp\\u003EBarring unthinkably radical change, we\\u0026#8217;ll hit 2 degrees in thirty or forty years and that\\u0026#8217;s been described as a catastrophe—melting ice, rising waters, drought, famine, and massive economic turmoil.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\u003C/blockquote\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EHe later explains why some climate scientists feel a need to go so extreme:\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cblockquote\\u003E\\u003Cp\\u003EAs Mann sees it, scientists like Schmidt who choose to focus on the middle of the curve aren\\u0026#8217;t really being scientific. Worse are pseudo-sympathizers like Bjorn Lomborg who always focus on the gentlest possibilities. Because we\\u0026#8217;re supposed to hope for the best and prepare for the worst, and a real scientific response would also give serious weight to the dark side of the curve.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\u003C/blockquote\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EAs a pension economist I understand the temptation to over-emphasize the worst case. Pension trustees and commentators often exploit the existence of risk to undermine retirement security. Suppose you don\\u0026#8217;t have enough money to fund pension promises made to future retirees. Odds are that will be a big problem and subject vulnerable people to poverty in their old age. But there\\u0026#8217;s a chance that if you do nothing things will work out. Your investments may all pay-off, people might die younger than you expect, or the economy may grow. It kills me to hear \\u003Ca href=\\\"http://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/18/opinion/krugman-the-dwindling-deficit.html?partner=rssnyt\\u0026amp;emc=rss\\u0026amp;_r=0\\\"\\u003Esome argue\\u003C/a\\u003E that the slim chance of the best case scenario justifies a wait and see approach, and—worse and more common—continuing to make new promises that can\\u0026#8217;t be paid.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EIt\\u0026#8217;s tempting to shout from the rooftops that this is a disaster waiting to happen, because the downside is so scary—even if it will only impact our grandchildren. More so for climate change where the stakes are so much bigger. But that only gives skeptics room to question climate scientists\\u0026#8217; findings. If anything, the existence of uncertainty provides the best case for swift action because the solutions (cap-and-trade, investment in renewables) are relatively cheap compared to what they will be in the future if worst cases are realized.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EPeople can understand this, and be willing to pay now to protect themselves—even if total disaster is unlikely and not imminent. After all the market for insurance exists, but there exists an entire industry that educates people on risk and why they should pay to minimize it.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\u003Cimg alt=\\\"\\\" border=\\\"0\\\" src=\\\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=qz.com\\u0026#038;blog=39587363\\u0026#038;post=491748\\u0026#038;subd=qzprod\\u0026#038;ref=\\u0026#038;feed=1\\\" width=\\\"1\\\" height=\\\"1\\\" /\\u003E\",\"comments\":\"http://qz.com/491748/climate-change-and-uncertainty/#comments\",\"pubDate\":\"2015-09-10T07:30:12-04:00\",\"category\":\"Uncategorized\",\"guid\":\"http://qz.com/preview/491748\",\"dc_creator\":\"Allison Schrager\",\"media_content_url\":\"http://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2015/08/elderlypool.jpg?quality=80\\u0026#038;strip=all\\u0026#038;w=150\",\"media_content_type\":\"html\",\"media_title\":\"elderlypool\",\"media_thumbnail_url\":\"http://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2015/08/elderlypool.jpg?quality=80\\u0026#038;strip=all\\u0026#038;w=150\"}"], ["link", "http://qz.com/491748/climate-change-and-uncertainty/"], ["published_at", Thu, 10 Sep 2015 11:30:12 UTC +00:00], ["title", "Climate scientists undermine their own science by avoiding the best case scenario"], ["updated_at", Thu, 10 Sep 2015 14:20:29 UTC +00:00]]

In May, ISIL executed close to 250 people as it took control of the ancient Syrian city of Palmyra. Recently, extremists \\u003Ca href=\\\"http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-34111092\\\"\\u003Eblew up Palmyra’s 2,000-year-old Temple of Bel. \\u003C/a\\u003E\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EAslan told Quartz that it’s not surprising that efforts to defeat ISIL with traditional military and weapons are proving difficult.

In these kinds of conflict there is no grey area.”\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cdiv class=\\\"embed-soundcloud\\\"\\u003E\\u003Ciframe width=\\\"500\\\" height=\\\"400\\\" scrolling=\\\"no\\\" frameborder=\\\"no\\\" src=\\\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?visual=true\\u0026#038;url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F223123978\\u0026#038;show_artwork=true\\u0026#038;maxwidth=500\\u0026#038;maxheight=750\\\"\\u003E\\u003C/iframe\\u003E\\u003C/div\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EThis simplistic binary of “good versus evil”—sanctioned by a perverse interpretation of religion —explains how ISIL’s barbaric violence has captured the attention of individuals like 24-year-old \\u003Ca href=\\\"http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/07/01/us-tunisia-security-idUSKCN0PB4VK20150701\\\"\\u003ESaif al-Deen al-Rezgui, who killed 38 people and wounded 39 others in a brazen attack on a Tunisian seaside resort \\u003C/a\\u003Ein June. Aslan believes extremists like al-Rezgui can “slaughter women, children, babies, because as far as they are concerned there are only two sides to this conflict: you are either on the side of God, (or) if you’re not on the side of God, then by definition, you’re on the side of the devil\\u0026#8230; and anything goes.”\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EThis “anything goes” philosophy of mass carnage includes targeted killings of religious minorities, especially Shia Muslims. In late June, a week after Kuwaiti authorities apprehended a cell of 12 ISIL terrorists, a bomb blast at a Kuwait City mosque \\u003Ca href=\\\"http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/06/26/isis-hits-shia-mosque-in-kuwait.html\\\"\\u003Ekilled 28 Shia worshippers\\u003C/a\\u003E during Friday prayers. However, Aslan cautions against labeling this a purely sectarian conflict. “Don’t think of it as sectarianism, think of it as a kind of radical extremist puritanism that has run amok,” he urges.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EISIL “wants to return to some kind of pure, unadulterated and frankly totally imaginary past. So obviously, the Shia is the most recognizable community that rejects this kind of Sunni Wahhabist puritanism. But it’s not just the Shia, it’s Sufis. It’s essentially any kind Muslim that does not share this kind of puritanical worldview. All of them are considered enemy.”\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EThe problem then, is whether anyone—including the US—can truly win a cosmic war.

You can\\u0026#8217;t lose a conflict when what’s at stake is your very sense of self. But you also can’t win a conflict like that because what you’re fighting for is the triumph of good over evil—that isn’t happening in our lifetime. Which is why we have to remember it’s not about land for these guys. Even calling them the Islamic State is a misnomer, because they aren’t interested in statehood, they aren\\u0026#8217;t interested in nationality, they have no interest in borders.”\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EDespite the challenges, Aslan does believe the US military has a responsibility to put a stop to ISIL’s “genocidal campaign across the Middle East.” However, Aslan says the US cannot win by engaging in an ideological battle. For this reason, Aslan applauds American president Barack Obama for ignoring the \\u003Ca href=\\\"http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/presidential-races/241566-huckabee-we-are-at-war-with-radical-islam\\\"\\u003Ecalls of many conservative politicians \\u003C/a\\u003Eto label the fight against ISIL as a fight against “radical Islam.” But, Aslan adds, “[ISIL’s fighters] are actually Muslims.”\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EEven though most practicing Muslims take great offense to comparisons between ISIL’s form of Islam and their own religion, Aslan himself defines a Muslim as “anyone who says he is a Muslim. That might make you uncomfortable, but it is also a fact. They say they are acting in the name of Islam, and we can’t ignore that. We have to take that seriously \\u0026#8230; They are a cancer in our midst and you can’t ignore a cancer.”\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EAt the same time, however, precision of language is required when labeling terrorists, something Aslan says America has repeatedly struggled with. “Look, if we haven’t figured this out already, terrorism is a meaningless word,” says Aslan. “The word ‘terrorist’ says much more about the person using the word than the person being described. At this point, it’s become very clear that it’s just become a word about ideology”—and Muslims.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EAslan can effortlessly rattle off examples of white men whose crimes fit the definition but were not branded terrorists in the US, from Andrew Joseph Stack, who \\u003Ca href=\\\"http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2013/05/remember-when-andrew-joseph-stack-flew-a-plane-into-a-texas-irs-building/275887/\\\"\\u003Eflew his plane into an IRS building\\u003C/a\\u003E, to white supremacist Wade Michael Page, who \\u003Ca href=\\\"https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/intelligence-report/2012/sikh-temple-killer-wade-michael-page-radicalized-army\\\"\\u003Ekilled six worshippers at a Sikh temple\\u003C/a\\u003E. Most notable recently of course is Dylan Roof, who \\u003Ca href=\\\"https://theintercept.com/2015/07/22/department-justice-didnt-charge-dylan-roof-domestic-terrorism/\\\"\\u003Ekilled nine black churchgoers \\u003C/a\\u003Eat the historic Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston, South Carolina, in July 2015.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003E\\u003Cspan class=\\\"pull-quote\\\"\\u003E\\u003Cspan class=\\\"quote-line\\\"\\u003E\\u0026nbsp;\\u003C/span\\u003E\\u003Cspan\\u003E“The word ‘terrorist’ says much more about the person using the word than the person being described.\\u0026#8221; \\u003C/span\\u003E\\u003Cspan class=\\\"quote-line\\\"\\u003E\\u0026nbsp;\\u003C/span\\u003E\\u003C/span\\u003EThe reluctance by some Americans to acknowledge Roof’s act as an act of terror signifies a “serious problem,” according to Aslan. “The problem is we are just racist. We are a country full of racists.” For further proof, Aslan points to the case of Robert Doggart, a Christian pastor from Tennessee, \\u003Ca href=\\\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/07/07/robert-doggart-indicted_n_7744168.html\\\"\\u003Ewho was indicted in July\\u003C/a\\u003E for allegedly plotting to massacre Muslims in New York State. Doggart had initially been released from jail and put on house arrest.\\u003Cu\\u003E \\u003C/u\\u003EAn incredulous Aslan offers a thought experiment: “Let’s pretend he’s not a Christian pastor from Tennessee trying to kill Muslims in New York. Let’s pretend he’s a Muslim imam from New York City trying to kill Christians in Tennessee. \\u003Cem\\u003EIt would be the sole topic of conversation in this country\\u003C/em\\u003E. And yet—have you heard of Robert Doggart?”\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EFor sake of fairness and uniformity (and because I, in fact, had heard of Doggart), I pressed Aslan to create a modern definition of terrorism, something that would apply regardless of skin color.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003E“Any individual, institution, organization or state that haphazardly targets civilians is accused of, stands accused of terrorism,” Aslan said. “That includes Hamas, it includes the State of Israel, it includes the United States, it includes Dylan Roof, it includes ISIL. Any individual, organization or state that haphazardly targets civilians—period—is accused of terrorism. It’s as simple as that.”\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EIf only it were that simple.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003E\\u003Cem\\u003EFollow Wajahat on Twitter at \\u003Ca class=\\\"ProfileHeaderCard-screennameLink u-linkComplex js-nav\\\" href=\\\"https://twitter.com/WajahatAli\\\"\\u003E@\\u003Cspan class=\\\"u-linkComplex-target\\\"\\u003EWajahatAli\\u003C/span\\u003E\\u003C/a\\u003E.

It’s a slightly different artform and it creates a different experience of fiction.”\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EAuthors have already embraced several different styles of writing Twitter fiction.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003ERita Raley, associate professor of English at University of California, Santa Barbara, told Quartz that Mitchell’s latest piece of Twitter fiction seems less compelling than his earlier work, though his use of modern vernacular “could work quite brilliantly.”\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EMeanwhile, Raley describes Egan’s Twitter story as “short poetic exercises”, where atomistic tweets are strung together to form a narrative.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cdiv class=\\\"embed-twitter\\\"\\u003E\\n\\u003Cblockquote class=\\\"twitter-tweet\\\" \\u003E\\n\\u003Cp lang=\\\"en\\\" dir=\\\"ltr\\\"\\u003EPeople rarely look the way you expect them to, even when you’ve seen pictures.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003E\\u0026mdash; New Yorker Fiction (@NYerFiction) \\u003Ca href=\\\"https://twitter.com/NYerFiction/status/205812891583131648\\\"\\u003EMay 25, 2012\\u003C/a\\u003E\\u003C/p\\u003E\\u003C/blockquote\\u003E\\n\\u003C/div\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EShe points to Teju Cole’s series of \\u003Ca href=\\\"https://storify.com/joshbegley/teju-cole-seven-short-stories-about-drones\\\"\\u003Eseven stories on drones\\u003C/a\\u003E as an example of fiction that can be told within one 140-character tweet.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cdiv class=\\\"embed-twitter\\\"\\u003E\\n\\u003Cblockquote class=\\\"twitter-tweet\\\" \\u003E\\n\\u003Cp lang=\\\"en\\\" dir=\\\"ltr\\\"\\u003E6.

It\\u0026#8217;s not really complicated. They want Hollywood movies and TV shows. They don\\u0026#8217;t want amateur hour. They want professional content.\\u0026#8221;\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EApple\\u0026#8217;s big move that day was to add Netflix support to a new, smaller, cheaper Apple TV device. Over time, it has added a handful of additional streaming partners, such as major sports leagues, TV networks, and digital-media companies.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EThe newest Apple TV, which the company unveiled yesterday (Sept. 9), goes another step forward: It adds an app store, so anyone can now build an app and potentially reach millions of people in their living rooms. Apple thinks this will dramatically change how people watch television at home. \\u0026#8220;We believe the future of television is apps,\\u0026#8221; Apple CEO Tim Cook proclaimed.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp class=\\\"p1\\\"\\u003E\\u003Cspan class=\\\"s1\\\"\\u003EPerhaps that\\u0026#8217;s true. But don\\u0026#8217;t expect a living-room app store to lead to some great, rapid democratization of content, or an indie-video renaissance. What you watch probably won\\u0026#8217;t change much. And, bigger-picture, this feels like a “plan b” move on Apple’s behalf. While a bunch of apps and the ability to search across them could eventually piece together Hollywood’s TV shows and movies, whenever—what Jobs said people wanted five years ago—it’s hardly the most elegant solution to an admittedly complex problem.\\u003C/span\\u003E\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EFor one reason, Apple is still keeping a tight grip on an important discovery mechanism, its Siri-powered universal search tool, which is billed as a major new feature. Apple will initially support only a small number of services: its iTunes store, Netflix, Hulu, HBO, and Showtime. (\\u0026#8220;And we\\u0026#8217;ll be adding even more over time,\\u0026#8221; iTunes boss Eddy Cue said.)\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cfigure id=\\\"image-499655\\\" class=\\\"inline-image  alignnone zoomable size-medium\\\"\\u003E\\u003Cimg src=\\\"https://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/apple-tv-grayified.jpg?quality=80\\u0026#038;strip=all\\u0026#038;w=640\\\" data-retina=\\\"https://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/apple-tv-grayified.jpg?quality=80\\u0026strip=all\\u0026w=1024\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" title=\\\"A-list.\\\"/\\u003E\\u003Cfigcaption class=\\\"inline-image-caption\\\"\\u003E\\u003Ci class=\\\"icon-camera\\\"\\u003E\\u003C/i\\u003EA-list.\\u003Cspan class=\\\"inline-image-credit\\\"\\u003E(Apple)\\u003C/span\\u003E\\u003C/figcaption\\u003E\\u003C/figure\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EWhat does that mean?

Or it also could restrict search to partners indefinitely. Today, the service seems to significantly favor iTunes and closely kept Hollywood partners.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EMeanwhile, new forms of video content have had more than a decade to erupt on the web. And while some interesting new categories have emerged—such as watching people play video games—the heavy majority of streaming bandwidth is still going to Netflix, which is as mainstream Hollywood as it gets. (YouTube places high, but a lot of YouTube \\u0026#8220;video\\u0026#8221; consumption is simply free music streaming.)\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cdiv class=\\\"atlas-chart\\\" data-id=\\\"41Vs4s9p\\\" data-width=\\\"640\\\" data-height=\\\"454\\\"\\u003E\\u003Cimg src=\\\"https://atlas.qz.com/i/atlas_41Vs4s9p.png\\\" style=\\\"max-width: 100%;\\\"\\u003E\\u003C/div\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EIt\\u0026#8217;s hard to see Apple TV changing this dramatically.

One important question is what will happen to the current television bundle, which is sold primarily through cable and satellite providers. But that\\u0026#8217;s nothing new, and smarter networks have been preparing for that future for years.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003E“All of this technology means you can choose more and be dictated less by a bunch of people who work in television programming,” AMC Networks CEO Josh Sapan \\u003Ca href=\\\"http://recode.net/2015/09/09/amcs-josh-sapan-is-a-little-excited-and-a-little-terrified-by-the-new-apple-tv/\\\"\\u003Esaid at a Recode event in New York yesterday evening\\u003C/a\\u003E. “I think that world is largely upon us pre- the Apple announcement.

But, let me lay out how this deal will work:\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EUnder this agreement, Iran is never allowed to build a nuclear weapon — period.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EEvery single pathway Iran could use is effectively blocked by this deal. Here\\u0026#8217;s how: It takes either enriched uranium or plutonium to build a nuclear weapon. The only site where Iran can create weapons-grade plutonium is at its Arak reactor. Under this deal, the core of the Arak reactor will be pulled out, filled with concrete, and replaced with one that will not produce weapons-grade plutonium. Furthermore, the spent fuel from that reactor will be shipped out of the country and Iran will not build any new heavy-water reactors for at least 15 years.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EThis deal also shuts off Iran\\u0026#8217;s uranium pathway by removing two-thirds of its centrifuges and getting rid of 98% of its stockpile of enriched uranium, which — right now — is currently enough for up to 10 nuclear bombs.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EAnd should Iran try to build a bomb in secret, this deal effectively cuts off that covert pathway too because of a robust and unprecedented inspections regime. There will be 24/7 monitoring of Iran\\u0026#8217;s key nuclear facilities and, for decades, international inspectors from the IAEA will have access to Iran\\u0026#8217;s entire nuclear supply chain \\u0026#8212; from uranium mines and mills to centrifuge productions facilities. For Iran to cheat, it would need a secret source for every single aspect of that supply chain. No nation in history has been able to pull that off, especially when faced with such rigorous and constant inspection.
